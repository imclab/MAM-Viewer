MAM-Viewer
==========

Our Application is aim to help the user to have a better way to assemble
things like toys or furniture. It is true that some people love that, but most
people suffer from it.
Our Application provides 3D viewing of the things to be assembled instead of
2D drawings and an interactive tutorial system to tell the user how to operate
step by step. We also add a AR function to the application so that if you have
small parts to install you can know exactly where it would be on the real things.
With these function people can assemble things effectively and will have a big
fun during the process.
